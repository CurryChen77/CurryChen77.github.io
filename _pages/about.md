<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year doctoral student from the School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Prof. Sifa Zheng. Prior to this, I graduated from NUAA (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) with a bachelor’s degree. 

My current research interests primarily revolve around learning-based autonomous driving planning and adversarial evaluation. Previously, I have also been involved in projects related to multi-modality perception. My ultimate goal is to leverage AI to empower autonomous driving, enabling the creation of safer and more reliable self-driving systems

**IGT: Illumination-guided RGB-T object detection with transformers**

**Keyu Chen**, Jinqiang Liu, Han Zhang

[**Paper**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705123001739?casa_token=uB0IUPawdkcAAAAA:xiqZf6isfEmqjSoG86H1J5PPAFZw0YT4QG8giHL0ADJNsXcyYcnzYd3ceq9tnZNWkTccpOXECDw) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

* We propose using illumination intensity to guide the fusion process of multi-modality features, enabling the comprehensive utilization of cross-modality complementary information in object detection.
